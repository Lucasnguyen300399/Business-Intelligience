#This analysis becomes particularly crucial as the company faces declining sales and operational losses. The goal was to provide actionable insights to support decision-making regarding potential office consolidations. The analysis considered
sales trends, top performers, best and worst-selling items, and predictive modelling for future sales, all based on the available sales data from these branches. The analysis unveiled a substantial variance in sales performance across the ten offices. While some offices maintained consistent performance, others exhibited declining trends.
Identification of top salespersons across all branches shed light on exceptional performers. Analysis of items sold revealed trends in both highly popular items and underperforming ones. Utilizing historical data, predictive modelling for the next 12 months projected potential sales.
Considering the data-driven insights, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. Offices that consistently underperform and show a declining trend, particularly those with
overlapping catchment areas, could be considered for consolidation. This strategic decision
aligns with the aim of reducing operational costs and ensuring the company's sustainability.
2. Initiatives to boost sales, such as targeted marketing campaigns or staff training, should be
implemented in branches experiencing declining sales.
3. The identification of best and worst-performing items provides an opportunity for inventory
optimization. Removing or reevaluating poorly performing items while focusing on popular
items can positively impact overall sales.
In response to the pressing issue of declining sales and the need to contemplate office consolidations, this analysis serves as a data-driven foundation to guide management decisions, it sheds light on the disparities in performance across our branches. It provides valuable insights into identifying potential areas for improvement and the necessity for strategic decisions in office consolidation to ensure the company's longevity.
